# Big-Data-Tableau-project
ANT Fleet Management
One of the leading causesÂ of injuries and deaths in the United States are the accidents caused by large trucks.
The objectives of our project are:

To identify the dangerous commercial truck drivers by analyzing the dataset based on various factors such as geographic location, vehicle type, average mileage, events, and Risk Factors.

To identify top 10 risky drivers based on their events reported and provide training to reduce the risk

To identify top 10 risky routes where events reported are high and therefore sending skilled drivers in that route

To identify event & event rates, mileage per model, therefore identifying models with less safety features, less efficient, such as blind spot, lane departure warning etc., and not to buy those model vehicles for business

Workload Management Dashboard in order to balance workload between drivers and models
